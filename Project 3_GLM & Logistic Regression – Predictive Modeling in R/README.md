Project Overview:
This project demonstrates the application of Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and logistic regression to classify and predict categorical outcomes. Using R, the project consolidates theoretical knowledge into practical modeling skills, including feature selection, model evaluation, and predictive analytics.

Purpose of the Assignment:

Build and interpret logistic regression models to classify universities as private or public.

Apply training/test splits to assess model generalization and prevent overfitting.

Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand dataset characteristics and trends.

Evaluate model performance using confusion matrices, accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, ROC curves, and AUC.

Implement feature selection methods (forward, backward, stepwise, best subsets) to optimize model predictors.

Compare models using ANOVA, AIC, BIC, Cp, and Adjusted R² to select the most appropriate model.

Key Skills Applied:

Data preprocessing, cleaning, and manipulation in R (dplyr, caret, tidyverse).

Building logistic regression models using glm() with multiple predictors.

Understanding and interpreting model metrics for classification performance.

Performing feature selection to identify optimal predictor variables.

Using statistical criteria (AIC, BIC, Cp, Adjusted R²) for model comparison.

Visualizing results via ROC curves and descriptive plots.

Tools and Methods:

R programming language for data analysis and modeling.

GLM (logistic regression) for binary classification tasks.

Training/test dataset splits to validate predictive models.

Feature selection algorithms: forward, backward, stepwise, and best subsets.

Model evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, ROC, AUC.

Statistical model comparison: ANOVA, AIC, BIC, Mallow’s Cp, Adjusted R².

Project Deliverables:

R Script containing all code for data import, preprocessing, model building, feature selection, and evaluation.

APA-style report including:

Title page, introduction, analysis, conclusions/interpretations, and references.

Expected Outcomes:

Build accurate logistic regression models to classify private vs. public universities.

Identify significant predictors using feature selection and model comparison methods.

Evaluate and interpret model performance on both training and test datasets.

Gain practical experience in predictive modeling, feature selection, and reporting results professionally.

Learning Competencies Demonstrated:

Application of GLM and logistic regression in practical scenarios.

Effective data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation in R.

Interpretation of model metrics and selection of optimal predictive models.

Communication of results in a structured APA-style report with visualizations.
