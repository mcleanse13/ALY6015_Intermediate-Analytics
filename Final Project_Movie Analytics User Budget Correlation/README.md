Final Project - Movie Analytics: User Interactions, Budget, and Popularity

Overview

This project investigates key relationships within a comprehensive movie dataset to provide actionable insights for the film industry. The analysis focuses on two primary questions: (1) whether user interactions correlate with movie features, and (2) whether a movie’s budget significantly affects its popularity. The project leverages R to conduct statistical analyses, generate visualizations, and develop predictive models.

Objectives

- Explore patterns in user interactions (ratings, views, comments) and movie features (genres, language, keywords).

- Quantify correlations between user engagement and movie attributes using the Pearson correlation coefficient.

- Examine the relationship between movie budgets and popularity through correlation and regression analysis.

- Provide predictive insights to inform budgeting strategies and recommendations for movie production.

Methodology

Data Preparation & Exploration:

- Conducted descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to summarize the dataset.

- Cleaned and formatted data for analysis in R.

Correlation Analysis:

- Computed Pearson correlation coefficients to evaluate the relationship between user interactions and movie features, and between budget and popularity.

- Visualized correlations using scatter plots, heatmaps, and regression plots.

Regression Analysis:

- Modeled the relationship between movie budget and popularity to make predictive recommendations.

- Evaluated the significance of predictors and their potential impact on decision-making.

Reporting & Visualization:

- Incorporated R code, outputs, tables, and figures into the analysis for transparency and replicability.

- Summarized results with actionable insights for film industry stakeholders.

Deliverables:

- Preliminary analysis report with EDA and descriptive statistics.

- Full project report including methodology, results, interpretations, and conclusions.

- Visualizations illustrating correlations and predictive relationships.

- 10-minute presentation summarizing key findings, methods, and recommendations.

Conclusion:

This project provides a data-driven exploration of user behavior and financial dynamics in the film industry. By uncovering correlations and modeling relationships, the analysis delivers insights that can guide recommendation strategies, budgeting decisions, and broader strategic planning in cinema.
