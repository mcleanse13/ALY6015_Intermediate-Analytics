Project Overview:
This project focuses on fitting, interpreting, and evaluating regression models using the AmesHousing dataset. The primary goal is to identify relationships between housing features and sale price while implementing diagnostic techniques to detect and correct common modeling issues, such as overfitting, multicollinearity, nonlinearity, and outliers.

Purpose of the Assignment:

Develop the ability to interpret and evaluate regression models using standard R functions.

Apply diagnostic methods to ensure model validity and accuracy.

Correct issues in regression models to improve predictive performance.

Select the best predictive model from multiple candidates using all-subsets regression.

Key Skills Applied:

Data preprocessing: handling missing values and preparing datasets for modeling.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA): descriptive statistics, correlation matrices, and scatterplots.

Regression modeling: fitting multivariate linear regression models and interpreting coefficients.

Diagnostic techniques: detecting multicollinearity, evaluating residual plots, and identifying outliers.

Model selection: comparing models and choosing the optimal predictors using automated methods.

Data visualization: creating plots and charts to communicate findings effectively.

Tools and Methods:

R programming language and relevant libraries (ggplot2, corrplot, ggcorrplot, leaps, etc.)

Statistical concepts: linear regression, correlation analysis, multicollinearity, residual diagnostics, and model selection.

Visualization techniques: scatterplots, regression plots, correlation heatmaps.

Project Deliverables:

R Script with all analysis steps under the heading Module 6.

Word or PDF report including:

Title page, introduction, analysis, conclusion/interpretation, and references.

Graphs, charts, and tables with interpretation.

Appendix containing all R code used for the analysis.

Expected Outcomes:

Improved understanding of regression diagnostics and model evaluation.

Identification of relationships between housing features and sale prices.

Selection of the optimal regression model based on predictive performance and statistical validity.

Learning Competencies Demonstrated:

Advanced regression modeling and diagnostics (CLO1, CLO2).

Handling complex datasets and improving predictive models.

Communicating technical results effectively for decision-making (PLOs: Communicating with Data, Business Analytics Agility, Statistics & Math, Advanced Analytics Tools).
