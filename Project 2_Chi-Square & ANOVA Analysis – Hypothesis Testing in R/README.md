Project Overview:
This project focuses on hypothesis testing using Chi-Square and ANOVA methods to examine relationships among categorical and continuous variables in multiple datasets. The primary objective is to determine statistical significance, assess independence, and evaluate differences between groups using R.

Purpose of the Assignment:

Apply Chi-Square tests for goodness-of-fit, independence, and homogeneity of proportions.

Use one-way and two-way ANOVA to detect differences among group means and interaction effects.

Interpret statistical outcomes, including p-values, critical values, and test statistics.

Develop proficiency in preparing data, performing exploratory analysis, and communicating results effectively.

Key Skills Applied:

Data preprocessing and exploration with R (dplyr, tidyverse).

Descriptive statistics and visualization to summarize datasets.

Hypothesis testing using Chi-Square and ANOVA methods.

Interpretation of statistical results including interaction effects in two-way ANOVA.

Visualization of findings through tables, charts, and graphs.

Communication of results in a structured APA-style report.

Tools and Methods:

R programming language for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical testing.

Chi-Square tests: Goodness-of-fit, test of independence, test for homogeneity.

ANOVA techniques: One-way ANOVA and Two-way ANOVA for group comparisons.

Graphical tools: histograms, bar charts, and scatterplots for exploratory analysis.

Project Deliverables:

R Script with all analysis steps, including data import, EDA, hypothesis tests, and visualizations.

APA-style report including:

Title page, introduction, analysis, conclusions/interpretations, and references.

Tables, charts, and figures with detailed interpretations.

Appendix containing all R code used in the analysis.

Expected Outcomes:

Determine whether categorical variables are independent or follow expected distributions.

Identify statistically significant differences among group means.

Understand interactions between factors in two-way ANOVA.

Gain hands-on experience in hypothesis testing and reporting statistical analyses professionally.

Learning Competencies Demonstrated:

Statistical reasoning and hypothesis testing (CLO4â€“CLO7, CLO9).

Data analysis and interpretation using R (Statistics & Math, Advanced Analytics Tools).

Communication of data-driven insights in a professional report format (Communicating with Data).

Application of analytical methods to real-world datasets for informed decision-making (Business Analytics Agility).
