Nonparametric Statistics, Sampling, and Simulation in R: Applying Tests, Correlations, and Probabilistic Modeling

Overview:

This project demonstrates the application of nonparametric statistical methods, sampling techniques, and simulation to solve real-world problems. Using R and MS Excel, I analyzed datasets to test hypotheses, compute correlations, and simulate experiments where traditional parametric assumptions may not hold. The goal is to develop practical skills for implementing these methods and interpreting results.

Objectives:

- Apply nonparametric hypothesis tests, including sign test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and runs test.

- Compute the Spearman rank correlation coefficient to assess monotonic relationships between variables.

- Explore the four basic sampling methods and recognize biases in survey questions.

- Use simulation techniques to model probability experiments and estimate expected outcomes.

Methodology:

Hypothesis Testing

- For each problem, state the null and alternative hypotheses, identify the claim, determine critical values, compute test statistics, and make decisions.

- Evaluate claims such as median attendance at football games, lottery ticket sales, prison sentence lengths, and baseball game outcomes using appropriate nonparametric tests.

Correlation Analysis

- Calculate Spearman rank correlation coefficients to examine relationships between paired datasets (e.g., subway and commuter rail passenger counts).

Simulation

- Use random number generation to simulate experiments such as collecting all prizes in caramel corn boxes or winning a lottery.

- Compute expected values through repeated simulations to understand probabilistic outcomes.

Data Handling

- Analyze datasets from sources including the OECD, American Public Transportation Association, and other real-world studies.

- Ensure reproducibility of results using R scripts and Excel worksheets.

Conclusion:

This project emphasizes the practical application of nonparametric methods and simulation for statistical inference, especially when assumptions of parametric tests are violated. By comparing hypotheses, evaluating correlations, and simulating experiments, students gain experience in problem-solving and data-driven decision-making.
